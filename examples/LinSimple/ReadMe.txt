This is a simple lin test example consisting of three frames.
The schedule table cyclically transmits one frame followed by two receive frames. The canalyzer configuration for lin is also included in the project.
The Transmit frame (ENG_TX 8 BYTES) comprises of 
8 bit signal (Signal_Tx_1) (Byte 0) Upcounter value transmitted
32 bit signal (Signal_Tx_2) (Byte 1,2,3,4) Downcounter value transmitted
24 bit signal (Signal_Tx_3) (Byte 5,6,7) Ones complement of above value

Receive Frame (LAMPS_RX 4 BYTES)
16 bit signal(Signal_Rx_1)(Byte 0,1) Random values in the range 0-65535 generated by Canalyzer
16 bit signal(Signal_Rx_2)(Byte 1,2) Increments at a step of 655

Receive Frame (TCM_RX 8 BYTES)
32 bit signal (Word_1) (Byte0-3) Toggles between 0 - uint32Max
32 bit signal (Word_2) (Byte4-7) Sine wave
